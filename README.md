> A simple development process for reuseable react components written in ES6.

## Assumptions
This repository gives you a starting point if you want to:
* develop reusable components independently
* use `browserify`
* write in ES6 using `babelify`
* use JSX
* write tests with [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape)
* maintain no separate css file, but use [inline styles](http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html) with react
* use simple npm scripts as a build process
* be able to understand the system and code in this boilerplate in 5 minutes

## Get started
Clone this repo, change the git origin to your repository, change package name (and version) in `package.json` and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/excellenteasy/react-component.git
cd TK
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git
vim package.json
npm install
```

You might also want to remove this README and write your own.

## Usage
You will most likely only need these one task:
`npm run serve`: sets up watchify and a livereload server; opens in your favorite browser

## How does this work under the hood?
### Important files
* `index.jsx`: This **is** your component, exported as an ES6 module. You can use ES6 and JSX syntax.
* `test.js`: Tests for your component go here. You can use ES6 here as well.

Remember: The only two files you should ever need to work on are `index.jsx` and `test.js`.

### Inside the code
If you look in [the source files](https://github.com/excellenteasy/react-component/blob/master/index.jsx), you will notice the [ES6 module syntax](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html). This is how you should export and consume your component. For an example on how a component is consumed, see [`example/app.jsx`](https://github.com/excellenteasy/react-component/blob/master/example/app.jsx).

### Build process
How is this wired up under the hood? We use [npm as a build system](http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run). The `serve` task creates a browserify bundle of `example/app.jsx`, which consumes the component. If then sets up watchers and livereload and opens the "app" in your favorite browsers. All of these jobs are completed by different node executables, which you can find in the devDependenceis in `package.json`.

Using simple node executables instead of complex Grunt or Gulp tasks makes it easy to reason about what is happening. If you know how to make the process more transparent or comprehendable, please open an issue/PR.

## Contributing
While I'd call this approach to component development "opinionated", that is no excuse to not take advice from others or keep improving. Please open an issue to discuss improvements/fixes or even better send a Pull Request. Thank you :)
